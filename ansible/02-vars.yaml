### Declare variable in play level then all the tasks can access that variable

### You can declare variable on tasks, However the scope is only that task.

## General good practice we dont start our user variable with ansible_ , because those are for System facts from ansible.

- name: run time variables
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Get uptime command output
      ansible.builtin.shell: uptime
      register: OUT
      ## OUT Is a variable
    - name: Print OUT
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "{{OUT.stdout}}"
    - name: Set fact
      ansible.builtin.set_fact:
        UPTIME_OUTPUT: "{{OUT.stdout}}"

## Variable values need not to be quoted while declaring
## Variable while accessing also need not to be quoted, Unless if the value is starting with variable.
## Meaning
## Hello {{URL}} need not to be quoted becuase this is not starting with variable
## {{URL} Hello , then yes it need to be quoted since it is starting with a variable
## Booleans while quoted considers as string,
## Number quoted are not consider as string, those are still consider as numbers.
