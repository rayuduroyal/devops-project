## if we assign a name to a set of data , then that is a variable
# syntax VAR=DATA

# number
a=100
# string
b=abc

# in bash shell and also wby default there are no data types, shell considers everything as string

# access the data in shell using $ charecter prifixing the variable name, or you can access variable with ${}

# echo value of a=$a
# echo value of b=$b
